```

The application will launch in full-screen mode and immediately start a 25-minute focus session.

### Pomodoro Cycle

The timer follows the classic Pomodoro Technique:

1. **Focus Session** (25 minutes) - Deep work time
2. **Short Break** (5 minutes) - Quick rest
3. **Repeat 4 times**
4. **Long Break** (15 minutes) - Extended rest
5. **Cycle repeats**

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Pause/Resume timer |
| `s` | Skip current session |
| `r` | Reset current session to full duration |
| `q` or `Ctrl+C` | Quit application |

## üé® Visual Experience

The application provides a rich visual experience:

- **Focus Sessions**: Dark blue background with white ASCII timer
- **Short Breaks**: Green-blue background for quick rest periods  
- **Long Breaks**: Darker blue-green background for extended rest
- **Large ASCII Timer**: Easy-to-read `MM:SS` format using block characters
- **Status Indicators**: Clear display of current session type and timer state
- **Help Footer**: Always-visible keyboard shortcuts at the bottom
